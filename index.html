        <h2>Progression</h2>
        <p>Progression should be small and incremental. Overload that is increased too rapidly can result in injury issues or muscle damage. For example, jumping from 50 pounds to 100 pounds in one session is too much for the body to handle. Instead, stick to small increases</p>

        <h2>Workout</h2>
        <p>Physical fitness is to the human body what fine tuning is to an engine. It enables us to perform up to our potential. Fitness can be described as a condition that helps us look, feel and do our best. Physical fitness involves the performance of the heart and lungs, and the muscles of the body</p>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Nutrition is the process of consuming, absorbing, and using nutrients needed by the body for growth, development, and maintenance of life. To receive adequate, appropriate nutrition, people need to consume a healthy diet, which consists of a variety of nutrientsâ€”the substances in foods that nourish the body.</p>
